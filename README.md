# robot-arm-control-dashboard
A minimalist web-based dashboard to control a 2-motor robotic arm. Users can adjust the angle of each motor using sliders and save their current positions to a local MySQL database using PHP and XAMPP.  The project is ideal for beginners in robotics or web development looking to integrate hardware control with a simple web interface.
